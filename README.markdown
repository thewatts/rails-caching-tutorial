# Blogger Advanced

This is a sample project for use with the tutorials at http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com

Please do _not_ take it as a set of best practices. In fact, there are many intentional inefficiencies or points of ugliness setup for "fixing" through [tutorial exercises](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby.html).


## Getting Started

```bash
git clone git://github.com/JumpstartLab/blogger_advanced.git
cd blogger_advanced
bundle
rake db:migrate
rails server
```
